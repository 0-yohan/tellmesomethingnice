          Its been 11 years since we first met, damn thats more than a decade. I
          remember someone saying `if a friendship lasts more than 7 years, its
          a family` or something like that. Guess we can call us a family now.
          Lol, that already happened long ago though.

          From talking about Games to listening to your Shayari, the time spent
          along with you was for sure is something memorable and I dont think
          anybody can replace that. I enjoyed it. All those moments, having fun
          or getting scolded or just those random chatter, they were all
          cherishable.

          Ugh, this is so awkward, embarassing and cringe, I'm sorryyyy, I'm so
          bad when it comes to confront or confess something. Sigh, I dont know
          what to say, we are slowly becoming adults now. You'll be handled
          responsibilities, or may already been handed over. Idk what to tell,
          it happened really fast, we grew up really fast.

          You have done really well until now, I'm proud of you. Keep on doing
          it, You can do it. You have it in you. I mean it bro. I'm really glad
          that we met. I'm really fortunate to have you in my life.

          Stand Proud, You're Strong. Happy 21st Birthday. May Allah make your
          lifespan long and prosper you with every good thing.
