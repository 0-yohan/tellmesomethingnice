          HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THE <br /> COOLEST PERSON EVER
        </div>

        <div className="letter-paragraph">
          Well, first of all, A very very happy birthday to the coolest person
          to ever exist, someone who reminds me of princess Jasmine from
          Aladdin, cheers for another year. So, how does it feel to get a letter
          from the bestestestest person in the world, hmph? Bruh lol, jk..idfk
          what in heavens made me the bestestestest person. Fr. Anyways, I hope
          that all your dreams come true, may you be blessed, may your rank rise
          high, may you get rich af and may luck follow your steps…and…uh…lol, I
          can't, this is becoming cringe🫰
          <br />
          Warning. It gets more cringier down below.
          <br /> <br />
          Dear Jahnavi, <br />Sigh… It feels weird writing a letter.
          <br />
          Idk how to start this. Theres a lot I want to write down here, <br />
          all the monologue I’ve been conversing with myself about you, <br />
          all the things that I wished to tell you but couldn’t dare to, <br />
          all the stuff I believe you deserve to know. <br />
        </div>
        <br />
        <div className="letter-paragraph">
        Sooo… I really really wished I could’ve given you this as an actual letter written on a paper with a pen but I’m sorry the circumstances aren’t allowing, the stars aren’t aligning. The universe doesn’t want it. UGGGH. Perhaps, the next time. If there is. But anyways, Ig I’ve picked up the pace so brace yourself girl this can become a long read because there’s so much I really wanna talk about, this could go on forever and ever and my yapping wouldn’t end. I wish time would stop and the universe would halt to give us our moment. Oh, I’m so excited, I can feel my heart racing, my mind going uneasy (I’m already mixing up words and making absurd sentence formations) so there might be so many mistakes and dumb metaphors or weird sentences but I hope it’ll reach you, I hope you’ll understand me.... I know you will, You’ve never failed to.
Even though I know how good of a reader you are and you can read this all off in about a minute but can you please take some time out and gimme some... attention :3 🥹
        </div>
        <br />
        
        <div className="letter-paragraph" >
        You saw me when I was invisible to others. You came just like a ray of moonshine gleaming upon a night blooming jasmine. You had so many common interests that I found a home in you. You became a heaven for me. Honestly dude, I fell a lot safe with you as if you’re my comfort zone, a sanctum, an asylum. You’re so kind, pure and non judgmental which makes it easier to open up to you ^^. Your beauty is so fragile, faultless and delicate as a painting from renaissance yet you’re valiant and unflinching like a warm beam of sunshine brightening up every corner it can reach. You know I saw fests photos of you wearing traditional and I swear you look so gorgjous (gorgeous), so much that Bollywood’s love songs were playing in my head. Damn, I swear those prettiest almond set of eyes over that angelic smile on that tiny, cutest face upon that enticing body. And ofcourse the way you style your hair. You’re beautiful. Ahh~ <br />
        I’ll never forgive myself for not being more social during college.
        <br /> <br />
        You’re simply…mesmerising and interesting and fun. I loved spending time with you. I love your music taste. I like how you make everything memorable.
        </div>
        <br /> 
        <div className="letter-paragraph">
        And oh ohh.. dyk how many times I had to deny that we had something going on? Bro…they used to ship us yk? Like fr, so you know Kishore na, so back then for some reason he used to ask me did I have any Gf’s or flings and all, I used to deny, he kept on insisting and one day he got his hands on my phone and after a lot of inspecting he finally checked discord and omg, the look on my face gave it away. He literally smirked, opened it and saw your id in the messages tab, but hmph, I somehow made it appear as if it was just for valorant and games. But it continued even after an year, he started teasing me ;-; side eyeing and lol a lot (I’m not complaining tho, I enjoyed it). But sometimes I used to think, what If I gave them the benefit of doubt, what if I didn’t try to avoid the allegations, and let the rumours flow XD. But nah, you wouldn’t have entertained that, like, imagine being shipped with that obnoxious, hopeless and lame kid. Damn, ask a way to spoil your reputation. So lol, I used to deny those accusations countless times but I secretly hoped for more. I wonder if they were able to see me blushing. You really made me feel butterflies in my stomach. I mean it.
        <br /> <br />
        And bruh, I really really want to apologize you for all of the times I ignored you and gave a blind eye to you in college. Like during those DCCN or AI labs, You used to purposefully save a seat for me or come and sit beside me and I used to make it as if I didn’t give a damn. Its not true, whenever you did that, it made butterflies spawn in my stomach and they used to fly wild, you wouldn’t believe how you made my heart flutter, my knees weak and made me fold by those actions. Your every little action, your tiniest effort to get closer to me, nothing went unnoticed. I noticed them all, its just that I pretended I didn’t care, I bluffed as if it didn’t bother me at all. But dyk inside in my heart it was totally opposite, I swear my heart pumped harder and harder, I was blushing inside out, you stuck a chord in me. I’m glad I had a mask on to cover those red cheeks. Oh my lord you were something. I used to get so flustered and upon that so shy ki, ahhh~ words used to get lost, my hands used to get froze, fog settled in my brain, I didn’t know what to do and then you try to start a convo and ah, critical strike, 100% damage. Do you remember once in AI lab, you tried to sit beside me and as soon as you sat, I gave an excuse and left for another place, and later you said that you saw Pranav looking at you disappointed cause you gave up sitting with them for me? Bro, you don’t know how much I craved to get closer to you too but you just make me so flustered that I make up lame excuses, I’m really so so sorry for being this much shy. But you know what, I really loved those moments(secretly, tsundre I am maybe). 
        <br /> <br />
        Dude, people take longer routes just to look at their crush and here was me, who took longer routes to avoid you😭lol ;-;. You know, I used to try everyday to hide from you, purposefully sit with my back towards the door in canteen during lunch just in case you randomly enter, you sometimes used to. Dyk, a whale is so big that its pussy can hold 7 humans. That makes it the 2nd biggest pussy after me who put more efforts into avoiding interaction with a girl irl rather than on studies. I hate myself so much for this. I am a stupid shy pussy baka idiot twit, sigh. But... Even though I had short term memory loss due to my condition, I still cherish those indefinite walks around campus, aimless wandering in library, randomly catching you here and there across the blocks or secretly looking at you in classes and labs trying not to get caught. And also all those times when you helped me with assignments and tests. Oh, I’m so grateful of you. Umm so Jahnavi, the treasure of my heart, won’t you forgive me for my nonchalance 🥺.
        <br /> <br />
        Oh! And also, im sorry for those times I played games on you. 😓Yeah, remember those times I tries to push you away, ignored your dm’s…sorrieee🙏
But then once you confronted me and when I asked why are you bothered and you said, that you have priorities and I am one of them ;-; 😭. I melted. I was at a loss of words. Thanks, you always made my day.
      <br /> <br />
      Lol, does it look like I’m being so down bad by saying all this? Does it look like flattery? Is it appearing so lame? My bad if it is. I just wanted to appreciate you, idk if it is coming off as an appreciation post, honestly I don’t want to go up or re-read it again and change it. That would be meddling with my feelings, even though I’m writing this with honestly down from my heart I don’t want to alter any thing and put it down right as it is coming it out. It just feels like as if my heart and hands are connected, there’s no role of brain here, there’s no filter in between, it’s all just natural. I’m just writing down without thinking although it might not be a good idea, it might get rude, but I don’t want to lie or polish my words.

      Heyyyy... how is that sweatshirt now. I really hope the colour didn’t wash off or it got wore off or anything, I was actually hesitant to give that one cause it wasn’t of good quality. Now I regret not giving that actual total black one which you really wanted. That H&M one. Hmm… you really liked that, didn’t you? Ahh I should have given that, I can’t wear it anymore anyways, you’d look drippin’ in it.
      <br /> <br />
      Would it make me appear like a creep if I lied that I never imagined kissing you? You were once tying up your hair into a short bun. You revealed your neck and that smooth exotic like skin was so desirable. Tempting, seductive and inviting. The thought of kissing the side of your neck was irresistible (I can still go into much more details on the hand placement and exactly which area of front corner of the neck and exactly how... and believe me I’m still fighting my soul, its hard. Its really driving).
      <br /> <br />
      I never thought I would think of you more than as a friend, but it didn’t took long. Yeah…you’re more than just a friend. Idk what you are to me, what do they call this thing or is there even a name for it. Idk, idc. Maybe just let’s give it a name, any name perhaps like a ‘rainbow’ like Na HeeDo does in 25 21 👉👈. 
      <br /> <br />
      Should I also tell, how much you raised my standards, in terms of women. Like holy shit you raised the bar so high that im sorry for all the girls even though I shouldn’t be expecting much from a wannabe partner, even though I don’t think I’ll date or anything but even casually lol, I’d reject anyone who wouldn’t put efforts as you did. 𝑖𝑙𝑦𝑠𝑚.
      <br /> <br />
      If anything, I so much miss teasing and bullying you, like…calling you flat but umm I was wrong tho, who cares if they are mountains or hills, we’d prefer green plains of Vinland 😉. I also miss making those silly dumb jokes, you always used to laugh on them. Umm… you really used to make me feel special. Everytime. And ofcourse, everytime I see my hands, they remind me of you, the one who appreciated them so much that I started loving myself too, so much that I started feeling good about myself. You liked them so much, I probably still remember every time you praised them and everytime I replied with, ‘wouldn’t they make a good necklace?’ that was so corny (cringe tbh) ;-; and that ring you gifted. So pretty. Thank you so much. If there’s anything I like about me now, it’s my hands and the reason is you. Hey, do you still have those small paper rings I gave? Umm, if you do, then you can open it and read it, I hope you didn’t open them already 🥲, I told you to not until I tell you to ;-;.
      <br /> <br />
      I still sometimes read your letter, wait, I’ll read it again right now, see again hahaha. You have a weird way of writing 8. It looks like 3. Wow. And damn it’s been 3 years already? I can’t believe. What the heck is your handwriting bro? It’s worse than a doctor. You should stick to a keyboard. Pens aren’t for you. Anyways let’s read the most awesome letter I’ve ever got once again- <br /> <br />
      -- “So how do you feel getting the letter from the most coolest person ever :smerk:?”<br />
Hmm…honoured, your highness.<br />
--“Supposed to be a Harry Potter themed letter but my handwriting is not cooperating :sadge:”<br />
LMFAO- can see that very well, its shitter than assignments lolol. Hey, ykw maybe next time I’ll make a Harry Potter themed one. Idk, I’ll try.<br />
-- “kys was kiss.”<br />
Yeah like wtf it was my first time reading kms and kys so ofc I thought kms meant kilometers and kys was like kiss. And the worst thing, I was once at book market and we were talking like <br />
‘hey I’m at this book shop, theres so many novels’<br />
‘ohh- get one’ <br />
‘hehe, I don’t have moni’<br />
‘dude, kys or that shopkeeper’<br />
and I was in a hurry or something and I thought you meant to kiss the shopkeeper and seduce him to give me books, like hey wtf girl..?!?!?! <br />
-- You went through my Pinterest and saw pick up lines pins. <br />
Bro I’m still embarrassed on that, ok fine, I agree I was once or twice looking upon such things but I didn’t save them 😭🙏Idk how or when they got there. Not that I care but... GUHHAHH.<br />
-- “Idk why you think you’re boring in person. But I like you better in person” <br />
𝐴𝑤𝑤٫ 𝐼𝑙𝑦 <br />
-- DCCN labs <br />
They are a core memory for me. Even though I felt bullied or suffocated sometimes. But tehe, I liked it. Stockholm syndrome fr. <br />
-- “It was worth it”<br />
Yes, it definitely was.<br />
-- “You made me feel epik when I was feeling down. Arigato”<br />
Hmm, I have something to tell you relating this, I’ll tell below. 😉
-- “I’m glad we started talking”<br />
I’m glad you matched my energy. I’m glad you weren’t biased. I’m glad you were nice.<br />
-- “Thanks for making this dreadful college life little bearable”<br />
Hey, thanks for making this awful life worth living. I’d be so lost if it weren’t you. You don’t know how lonely it was. Thanks, Arigato 😊<br />
-- “Bracelets look sick on you”<br />
Do they? Well thanks ig, I just tried them cause I though my wrists looked very thin and to cover that wrist bone that sticks out. <br />
-- “Also srsly get some bitches, not telegram ones”<br />
Lol, sorry, you were right. Had to learn it the hard way. But duh~ I’m done ffs. Idk if Agape exists anymore. Doesn’t seem so. Well lol, I’m done with chasing girls. :/ <br />
-- “It was fun playing minecraft with you...”<br />
Mhmm... it was fun. Even though, I was so dumb and fumbling everything but it was fun hearing you laugh. I liked making you laugh. Chuckle and Giggle. I like your laugh. ^ ^<br />
-- “Should I say like... happy birthday yarooo”<br />
No, weird combination of English and local pure Hyderabadi urdu slang.<br />
-- “Or like your mom would say ‘Janam din ke shubkaminayein putar’”<br />
Ffs, No. My. Mom. Doesn’t. Call. Me. Putar. And we speak urdu not hindi 🤌
<br /><br />
Sighh…That was one of the loveliest letter. :3 and certainly accompanied by one of the sweetest gift. <br /> 
A day doesn’t go by without a thought of you crossing my mind atleast once. It hopelessly makes me smile. <br />
You know, in a world where everyone says 𝑗𝑢𝑠𝑡 𝑘𝑒𝑒𝑝 𝑠𝑤𝑖𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑔 you 𝑔𝑎𝑣𝑒 𝑚𝑒 𝑎 𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑜𝑛 𝑡𝑜 𝑠𝑤𝑖𝑚. <br />
You’re my purple. <br /> 
“I’m God” you say, lol, ironic. Sarcastic. Ridiculous. 🤡<br />
Though it’s the biggest sin but-<br />
You are my religion. And this is my 𝑆𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑡 𝐵𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑝𝘩𝑒𝑚𝑦.
<br /> <br />
Maybe I told a lie. I lied that you resemble like so and so. But I’m wrong. You’re unique. You’re different. You aren’t like anybody. Just like how no two snowflakes are similar. <br /> <br />
Phew…I don’t want to make it more cornier so hmm... let’s talk about this.
So I don’t know if you remember, once you were asking what I was upto and it looked like you were really feeling blue and wanted to just like talk to feel better. But I was watching a movie with that telegram girl and couldn’t tend you. Hearing upon that you just left, and it was so stupid of me to not get it. And the next day you said that it was nothing, you were just feeling down because of periods and mood swings and then it hit me how ignorant I was. And then it hit me ki, what if it happens again, what if you might be feeling down and might just want to hear some words of affirmation. What if I’m not around anymore to reassure you, what if you’re off mood again and just want to hear some comforting words. I really was regretting what happened and didn’t want it to happen again. Even though I know it might’ve and I’ve failed. But then…I thought of making this site. A website. Tell Me Something Nice. Here’s the link: <a href={"https://tellmesomethingnice.vercel.app/"}>https://tellmesomethingnice.vercel.app/</a> or there’s a button at the bottom right that’ll take you directly there. So, it gives you sentences of affirmation or consolation and reassurance. Whenever you need some words to cheer you or give you comfort, just click the button and a random quote pops up, trying its best to turn your frown into a smile and rising up your spirits (I’m not sure why it’s not working on phones, I’ll try to fix that). <br />
Well, this was the idea, and I was actually supposed to gift this site to you last year but umm sorry🙏, I got sick and couldn’t finish it in time. And also the quotes, umm sorrie once again🙏, I’m still filling up the list so there aren’t many quotes as of now, just 8 ig, but daijoubu, I’ll keep on feeding it with soothing sentences. Well yeah, that’s about it. A website that will try to cheer you and make you feel better whenever you’re upset or feeling down. I hope you like it, even though its imperfect as of yet. I wonder if it’ll will be enough to remember me. I wonder if it’s good enough to be a token of remembrance.
<br /> <br />
Talking about websites, guess what clicked my head? Yeah. Jazzthoughts. HADGSASHHA, broooo, that was epic. Redstone. Dude it was interesting. Really. A murder mystery thriller. You should continue. You are good. Or maybe you are writing somewhere else and are hiding from me cause Ill make fun? Is it? Dude please…I would really like to read. And if you’re hiding it…May you get allergic to chocolates. And I’ll touch you (inappropriately).
<br /> <br />
Phewwww…. Ah, haven’t let these many thoughts out ever. Maybe I like this. But tsk tsk, I wanted to finish this in 3105 words but looks like we’ve already crossed that mark. Maybe I should learn wordplay to make stuff interesting to read and convey more feelings with less words or probably should’ve started writing this early. Gosh my fingers are hurting. I’ll continue later, tata, byee. 
<br /> <br />
Hallo. I’m so sorry, I just realised I’ve been so selfish by just talking about myself. Didn’t mean to, just wanted to show you how much of an influence you are, how much you changed my life, turning it upside down. Well, I’ve yapping just about myself while its your day. Psspsspsspss... let’s get about serious now.
<br /> <br />
America huh. Well, that’s so fun just to think about it and that too NYC. It’s a dream. But hey, just because you don’t have eyes watching you that doesn’t mean that you can now sleep in cupboards or shelves and Spend whole day gaming with all lights turned off. You better take care of yourself. Ain’t you 22 now? That’s an age where you’ll be start being responsible for all the shit that you take upon. You’ll be meeting a lot of people, everyone different, a lot of different kinds with various personalitities, mindsets, goals, charms and a lot other characteristics. But be yourself, never let others judgements bother you. Be wary of hidden spy cameras and guys taking advantage of you. Sleep well, don’t be afraid of ghosts under the bed or in walls. I don’t think you’ll be afraid, you watch more gore and horror stuff than anyone I know. Life may get hard or easy or boring or become a rollercoaster. But keep yourself strong. Stiffen up that upper lip. Don’t give up. Always know that you aren’t alone, there are many people who’ll support you, right now and as well as in future. You have people who are behind you to hold you incase you fall down. There are people beside you to give you a shoulder to rely on. There are ones infront of you to lead you. Just live the life you dream. And also, get a cool boyfriend you asexual pollen allergic A-cup dork.
<br /> <br />
Aye…One last request. You can stop keeping an eye on me. Or keeping me in check. Or whatever you think you’re doing. Just move on. Don’t force yourself when you’re not interested. I hope you get it, cause I don’t 😐. I mean, I know but idk how to put that in words but I hope you understand it without a tryhard explaining. My bad, I should learn wordplay or eloquence.
<br />
Another thing I might want you to know. There probably won’t be a next time. The truth is, the meds I’m taking have a side effect. It’s having suicidal thoughts. And ig the meds are working fine enough considering how much I’m losing interest in everything, literally everything and having an existential crisis. Well ofc, nobody knows about this but I just wanted to let you know to not let any misunderstandings develop (probably my overthinking) such as you might think I’m purposefully ignoring you or losing interest or playing mind games or anything. But no, its that my mind is a mess, I forgot most of my childhood and most of recent stuffs, I don’t have any will to live and pretty much have no interest in anything. Idk how it end up like this, it feels like I’m falling into a deeper hole than the one you found me in. Tsk tsk, I’ve gotten to start talking about myself again. Such a bad habit. You know, I wish I could’ve written this letter how Kaori writes to Arima Kousei in Your Lie in April🥹.
<br /> <br />
Although there’s a lot I wish I could still write but I suppose I would better stop. This might have been a very long read and I shouldn’t be taking this much time on your birthday. Plus, there are barely hours for the clock to strike 12, I should finish this and push it up. 
<br /> <br />
That sums it up. I really pray this wasn’t so cringe. Although I bet it was. 😭 <br />
And once again 𝐂𝐇𝐄𝐄𝐑𝐒 𝐓𝐎 𝐀𝐍𝐎𝐓𝐇𝐄𝐑 𝐘𝐄𝐀𝐑 𝐀𝐍𝐃 𝐇𝐀𝐕𝐄 𝐀 𝐅𝐀𝐁𝐔𝐋𝐎𝐔𝐒 𝐁𝐈𝐑𝐓𝐇𝐃𝐀𝐘. <br /> <br /> 
PS: Here's a childish picture that I'll treasure my whole life. <br />
