    <h1>So the day has come huh?</h1>
    <p>
        Its been 11 years since we first met, damn thats more than a decade. I remember someone 
        saying `if a friendship lasts more than 7 years, its a family` or something like that. 
        Guess we can call us a family now. Lol, it happened long ago though.

        From talking about Games to listening to your Shayari, the time spent along with you was 
        for sure is something memorable and I dont think anybody can replace that. I enjoyed it.
        All those moments, having fun or getting scolded or just those random chatter, they were 
        all cherishable.

        Sigh, I dont know what to say, we are slowly becoming adults now. You'll be handled responsibilities, 
        or may already been handed over. Idk what to tell, it happened really fast, we grew up really fast.

        You have done really well until now, I'm proud of you. Keep on doing it, You can do it. You have it in you.
        I mean it bro. I'm really glad that we met. I'm really fortunate to have you in my life.

        with every good thing.
